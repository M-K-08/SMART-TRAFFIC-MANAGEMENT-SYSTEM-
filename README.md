# SMART-TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-
In-country like India, billions of people start and end each working day stuck in traffic or commuting on congested trains and buses. It is vital to the quality of life to enhance the everyday commute. ​
Slowed synchronization of traffic signals leads to traffic congestion and delays. ​The pre-programmed, regular signal timing patterns are employed in traditional signal systems. ​
The Adaptive Traffic Control System (ATCS) is a traffic management technique that modifies or adapts the timing of traffic signals based on the real demand for traffic and achieved using a control system that includes both hardware and software, where hardware is the sensor used for real-time traffic density estimation and software is designed using captured data analysis of the city's current traffic flow.
Congestion of traffic has been a matter of routine in any existing metropolitan region with an overwhelming population but minimal infrastructure. Traffic Congestion is a critical problem with dire causes and consequences on the road. ​
Radical population growth and low public quality transportation have caused vehicles to expand massively. ​
Poorly controlled traffic, apart from infrastructure, creates congestion that could survive for hours. Only to a certain degree can a pre-defined timing scheme for traffic control ease the problem. ​
The solution to these problems is to provide an adaptive system that works in accordance with the number of vehicles lanes. This traffic system counts the number of vehicles in the lane, compares the data from other lanes, and, based on the number of vehicles, determines whether to offer priority to reducing the average waiting time or reducing congestion/pollution in the lane.​
